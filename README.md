### run_analysis.R

The script that can be download and run to generate tidy data (output.txt). 

The script perform the following

        - create working directory
        - download the file into working directory
        - unzip the file
        - read 8 files
            - tbl_activity
            - tbl_features
            - x_test
            - y_test
            - subject_test
            - x_train
            - y_train
            - subject_train
        - the feature description was improved because header cannot have character such as -, ( and )
        - combine test data as single table known as tbl_test
        - combine train data as single table as tbl_train
        - combine test and train into single table as tbl_data_1
        - select only features that represent mean and std as tbl_data_2
        - replace activity id with activity description and stored as tbl_data_3
        - perform average group by activity and subject and stored as tbl_data_4
        - output the result as file
